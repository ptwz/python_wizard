This project is a python port of the great macOS tool BlueWizard, which is written in objective C and I was not familiar enough with this C dialect to make an portable command line application out of it.

It is intended to convert (voice) audio streams into LPC bitstreams used in the TMS 5220 chip or e.g. in the Arduino library Talkie. Now you can generate your own LPC streams and make your chips say the things you want them to.

Compared to BlueWizard some minor features have been added:
1. Ability to downsample a wave file automatically
2. Automated output formatters for C, Arduino (C-Dialect) and plain hex

Prerequisites:
- Python 2.7
- SciPy >= 0.18.1

Usage: 
       python_wizard.py [-h] [-u UNVOICEDTHRESHOLD] [-w WINDOWWIDTH] [-U] [-V]
                        [-S] [-p] [-a PREEMPHASISALPHA] [-d] [-r PITCHRANGE]
                        [-F FRAMERATE] [-m SUBMULTIPLETHRESHOLD]
                        [-f {arduino,C,hex}]
                        filename

positional arguments:
  filename              File name of a .wav file to be processed

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u UNVOICEDTHRESHOLD, --unvoicedThreshold UNVOICEDTHRESHOLD
                        Unvoiced frame threshold
  -w WINDOWWIDTH, --windowWidth WINDOWWIDTH

  -U, --normalizeUnvoicedRMS
                        Normalize unvoiced frame RMS
  -V, --normalizeVoicedRMS
                        Normalize voiced frame RMS
  -S, --includeExplicitStopFrame
                        Create explicit stop frame (needed e.g. for Talkie)
  -p, --preEmphasis     Pre emphasize sound to improve quality of translation

                        Comma separated range of available voice pitch in Hz.
                        Default: 50,500
  -F FRAMERATE, --frameRate FRAMERATE
  -m SUBMULTIPLETHRESHOLD, --subMultipleThreshold SUBMULTIPLETHRESHOLD
